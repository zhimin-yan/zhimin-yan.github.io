										Hello! My name is ZhiMin Yan, or you can just call me Z, and I recently completed an exciting CRM app project called INTENTIONS with four other talented individuals. 
										Our app leverages AI to help users turn summaries into notes, track what was last discussed, and generate unique questions based on their conversations. 
										Additionally, INTENTIONS features a robust reminder and notification system to keep users on top of their interactions and tasks. 
										Completing this project has been an incredible journey, allowing me to combine my passion for technology and innovation to create a tool that genuinely helps people manage their relationships and conversations more effectively.
									</p>

									<p>
										Outside of my work on INTENTIONS, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and inspired. 
										I am an avid gamer, enjoying RTS, FPS, MOBA, and MMO games, while recently I have been playing Wuthering Waves.
										Gaming provides a fun way to connect with friends and challenge myself strategically.
										In addition to gaming, I enjoy the intricate and rewarding process of building Gundars, currently working on the RX-93 model. 
										Reading is another passion of mine; I'm currently immersed in the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan and look forward to exploring his other works. 
										Lastly, drawing is a wonderful way for me to relax and unwind, even though I don't do it as often as I'd like.
									</p>

									<p>
										Overall, my primary focus has been on making INTENTIONS the best it can be, while my diverse hobbies provide a well-rounded balance to my life. 
										I am driven by a desire to create meaningful and innovative solutions, and I am excited about what the future holds for INTENTIONS and beyond.
									</p>
